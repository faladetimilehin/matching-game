# 🌍 FaceDuo 🌍

## Overview 🌟

FaceDuo is a fun and interactive facial expressions memory game aimed at children with autism, ADHD and communication difficulties. It is an effective tool for neurodiverse children to help them learn facial expressions and boost their memory whilst playing a card-based game.

## How it Works 🌟

- Players click or tap to turn over the cards, each of which bears a facial expression. Within the deck of cards, there are two matching cards bearing the same facial expression (e.g. 'sad', 'happy' or 'confused'.)
- When the player matches two cards, the cards will stay on screen and display the text word for the emotion. A 'correct' noise will play.
- If the two cards selected do not match, they will flip back over and an 'incorrect' noise will play.
- Once all of the cards have been matched, confetti will appear on screen and the player will have the chance to play again.

## User Story ✨

Children who play this game are likely to have communication difficulties such as making friends or behaving appropriately during school lessons. They want to play a fun game that will keep them entertained. They are likely to be introduced to the game by their parents, who want to support their emotional and social development whilst keeping them safe.

## Additional Features

- A 'turns' counter so players can track how many turns it took them to match the cards.
